    <!--
        Animations are used to animate HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!
        Animations are created with @keyframes rule.
        To use animation, you must specify two properties, that is, animation-name and animation-duration.
        There are many animation properties, which are explained below.
    -->
    <!--
        animation-name: Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation.
        animation-duration: Specifies how long time the animation takes to complete one cycle.
        animation-delay: Specifies a delay for the start of an animation.
        animation-iteration-count: Specifies the number of times an animation should be played.
        animation-direction: Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.
        animation-timing-function: Specifies the speed curve of the animation.
        animation-fill-mode: Specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).
        animation-play-state: Specifies whether the animation is running or paused.
    -->

    <!--
        @keyframes Syntax:
        @keyframes animation-name {
            0% {property: value;}
            50% {property: value;}
            100% {property: value;}
        }
